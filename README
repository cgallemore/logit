Some times you just need to write something down.  Since I spend most of my day at the command line anyways, this is just a simple means to accomplish that.  Usage is as follows:

1. Get the logit executable
- wget https://raw.github.com/cgallemore/logit/master/logit
- Make it executable, e.g. sudo chmod +x logit

2. Create a symbolic link, for example:
- sudo ln -s ~/logit /usr/local/bin/logit

3. logit "Drop's mic..."
4. cat ~/.logit/*.log

The location of where logit writes the log files is configurable by setting the environment variable LOGIT_LOCATION.  If it's not set, the default location is ~/.logit.  For example if you want to save your files in your Dropbox folder so you can access them from anywhere, you would do the following:

export LOGIT_LOCATION='~/Dropbox/logit'

Now all your logit files will appear in the logit folder in your Dropbox.
