Some times you just need to write something down.  Since I spend most of my day at the command line anyways,
this is just a simple means to accomplish that.  Usage is as follows:

1. Get the logit executable
- wget https://raw.github.com/cgallemore/logit/master/logit

2. Create a symbolic link, for example:
- sudo ln -s ~/logit /usr/local/bin/logit

3. logit "Drop's mic..."
4. cat ~/.logit/*.log
