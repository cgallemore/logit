Some times you just need to write something down.  Since I spend most of my day at the command line anyways, this is just a simple means to accomplish that.  Usage is as follows:

1. Get the logit executable
- wget https://raw.github.com/cgallemore/logit/master/logit

2. Create a symbolic link, for example:
- sudo ln -s ~/logit /usr/local/bin/logit

3. logit "Drop's mic..."
4. cat ~/.logit/*.log

Logit creates a .logit directory in your home directory and creates a file based on the current day.  As you log entries throughout the day, logit appends to the file and prepends each entry with a time so you can have a chronological view of entries.
