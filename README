Logit - Log a note from your terminal
=====================================

Some times you just need to write something down.  Since I spend most of my day at the command line anyways, this is just a simple means to accomplish that.  Usage is as follows:

* pip -e git+git://github.com/cgallemore/logit.git#egg=logit or clone the project and python setup.py install
* Open a terminal and logit:

<pre>
>>> logit "When you come to a fork in the road, take it."
>>> cat ~/.logit/*.log
When you come to a fork in the road, take it.
>>> logit "A nickel ain't worth a dime anymore." -s
When you come to a fork in the road, take it.
A nickel ain't worth a dime anymore
</pre>

By default logit will write a daily log file in the format logit-mm-dd-yyyy.log to your home directory.  If you wish to write those files elsewhere, you can set the following environment variable:

* export LOGIT_LOCATION='~/Dropbox/logit'

Now, the daily log file will be written to the logit folder in your Dropbox folder.
